Or you can download the source from this repository,  and then do the manual install:
Download the [zip file](https://github.com/global-input/chrome-extension/archive/master.zip) and extract it into a folder.  If you have git installed on your computer, you can clone the git repository into a folder on your computer. Then, click on the "Window" menu of your Chrome Browser. Look for the "Extensions" menu item from the menu items listed. Clicking on the "Extensions" menu item will lead you to the Chrome Extensions list.  If you click on the ```Load unpacked extensions...``` button on the top, a file selection window will appear. Please  select the folder, to which you have downloaded the chrome extension. And then click on the ```select``` button in the File Selection Dialog window. This adds the Global Input to the "Extensions" list.  

After the installation, you should be able to see a Global Input Icon at the right hand side of the address bar of your Chrome browser. Please click on it to confirm that it is installed.




### How To Use

Now you can load your favourite web applications such as Confluence, Jira, Lucidchart, AWS console, Dropbox etc with your Chrome browser and sign in with your mobile.

When the Sign In page is being displayed, click on the "Global Input App" icon,  which is located on the right hand side of the address bar of your browser. Clicking on the icon should pop up a small window. The window contains a title "Global Input App" and a button "Enable For This Page". Clicking on the button should make the current page display a QR Code alongside the Sign In form.

You can now scan the QR code using the Global Input App (available in [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/global-input-app/id1269541616?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) and [Android](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/global-input-app/id1269541616?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)) with your mobile.

When you scan the QR Code using the Global Input App, a Sign In Form will be displayed on your mobile screen. When you are filling the form on your mobile, the form on the computer screen will be filled in automatically in-time similar to a Remote Desktop session. After finished filling the form, you can save the form content in your mobile device so you can reuse it to automate the process next time.

This way, you can automate the various processes on the applications running on computer, Smart TV and other devices. If you have any questions or run into any issues, please contact me on dilshat@iterativesolution.co.uk.
