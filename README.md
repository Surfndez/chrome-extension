# Global input chrome extension


This is for enabling chrome to support the Global Input software so that you can use your mobile to login instead of typing on the computer screen. Since your mobile will remember your password and auto-fill the form, you can speed up the login process. For example, when you go to confluence, JIRA, github, gitlab, Lucidchart and the wordpress websites etc, it will display a QR code,  so that you can connect with the Global Input mobile app (available in [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/global-input-app/id1269541616?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) and [Android](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/global-input-app/id1269541616?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)) to your the confluence by pointing your phone camera to the QR code.
